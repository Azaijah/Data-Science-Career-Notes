#statistics 

**The null hypothesis**, symbolized as $H​_0$, is a statement used in statistics that suggests no significant effect or difference exists in a given set of observations; it represents a default position that there is no association between two measured phenomena. 

The **alternative hypothesis**, denoted as $H_1$​, posits that there is a significant effect or difference, indicating a specific direction of association or outcome that contradicts the null hypothesis. 

In [[hypothesis testing]], the objective is to determine whether the observed data provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, thereby supporting the presence of a statistically significant effect or difference.


**Four possible outcomes of a statistical hypothesis test:**

1. **Correct Decision (True Negative)**
   - When you do not reject $H_0$ and $H_0$ is true, you've made the correct decision. This is analogous to declaring an "innocent" person innocent.

2. **Type II Error (False Negative)**
   - When you do not reject $H_0$ but $H_0$ is false, you've committed a Type II error. In a court analogy, this is like declaring a "guilty" person innocent.

3. **Type I Error (False Positive)**
   - When you reject $H_0$ and $H_0$ is actually true, you've made a Type I error. In the court analogy, this is similar to convicting an "innocent" person.

4. **Correct Decision (True Positive)**
   - When you reject $H_0$ and $H_0$ is false, you've made the correct decision. This would be like correctly finding a "guilty" person guilty.
