The null hypothesis, symbolized as $H​_0$, is a statement used in statistics that suggests no significant effect or difference exists in a given set of observations; it represents a default position that there is no association between two measured phenomena. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis, denoted as $H_1$​, posits that there is a significant effect or difference, indicating a specific direction of association or outcome that contradicts the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the objective is to determine whether the observed data provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, thereby supporting the presence of a statistically significant effect or difference.
