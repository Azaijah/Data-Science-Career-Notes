1. **Point Estimate Overview**:
   - Essentially, a point estimate is a solitary numerical figure proposed as the best guess or prediction of a population parameter.
   - A commonly used point estimate example is the sample mean, symbolized by $( \bar{x} )$.
   - The reliability of point estimates is often questioned due to their susceptibility to error. Given the variability inherent in sample data, a point estimate may not always accurately capture the true value of the population parameter it seeks to estimate.

2. **Interval Estimate Explained**:
   - In contrast, an interval estimate encompasses a range of numerical values within which the true population parameter is presumed to reside.
   - Confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean serve as a pertinent illustration of interval estimates.
   - Confidence levels, typically set at 95% or 99%, express the degree of certainty or confidence that the specified interval encloses the actual population parameter.
   - Owing to their consideration of sample data variability and uncertainty, interval estimates are regarded as markedly more dependable. Unlike point estimates that provide a singular value, interval estimates offer a value range, thereby presenting a more robust method for estimating population parameters that accommodates the inherent uncertainties of sampling.
