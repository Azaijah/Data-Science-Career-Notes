Frequency distributions are a basic yet powerful tool in statistics for summarizing a set of data. They show how often each unique value appears in a dataset. Essentially, a frequency distribution is a way to organize data so that you understand at a glance the frequency (or occurrence) of each value or range of values within a dataset. There are several types of frequency distributions, including:


1. **Univariate Frequency Distributions**: This involves a single variable and is used to understand the distribution of values for that variable. It can be represented in a table, graph, or chart.
    
2. **Bivariate and Multivariate Frequency Distributions**: These involve two or more variables. Bivariate distributions examine the relationship between two variables, while multivariate distributions involve more than two variables.
    
3. **Absolute Frequency Distribution**: Shows the number of times each value appears in the dataset.
    
4. **Relative Frequency Distribution**: Shows the proportion or percentage of times each value appears relative to the total number of observations. This is useful for comparing datasets of different sizes.
    
5. **Cumulative Frequency Distribution**: Shows the cumulative total of frequencies up to a certain value. This helps to understand the distribution of data across intervals.
