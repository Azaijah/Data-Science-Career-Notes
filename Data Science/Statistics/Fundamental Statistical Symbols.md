### Basic Symbols

- **$n$**: Sample size or the number of observations in a sample.
- **$\mu$**: Population mean, the average of a set of data including all members of the population.
- **$\bar{x}$**: Sample mean, the average of a set of data from a sample of the population.
- **$\sigma$**: Population standard deviation, a measure of the dispersion or variability of a dataset.
- **$\sigma^2$**: Population variance, the square of the population standard deviation.
- **$s$**: Sample standard deviation.
- **$s^2$**: Sample variance.
- **$p$**: Population proportion.
- **$\hat{p}$**: Sample proportion.

### Hypothesis Testing

- **$H_0$**: Null hypothesis, a statement of no effect or no difference.
- **$H_a$ or $H_1$**: Alternative hypothesis, a statement that there is an effect or a difference.
- **$\alpha$**: Significance level, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
- **$p$-value**: The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
- **$t$**: Test statistic for a t-test.
- **$z$**: Test statistic for a z-test.
- **$\chi^2$**: Test statistic for a chi-squared test.
