### 1. Mean (Average)
The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency of a data set.
$$\text{Mean} (\bar{x}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean, $n$ is the number of observations, and $x_i$ are the individual observations.

### 2. Median
The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in order.

### 3. Mode
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.

### 4. Variance
Variance measures the spread of a data set.
$$\text{Variance} (\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$
where $\sigma^2$ is the variance, $x_i$ are the individual observations, and $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the observations.

### 5. Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion.
$$\text{Standard Deviation} (\sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
