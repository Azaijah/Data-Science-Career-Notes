- **All hypothesis tests make certain assumptions for the test results to be valid.**
    - **Study Design Assumptions** – This involves the correct choice of which statistical test to perform, based on how the study was designed and the type of data collected.
    - **Data Assumptions** – This relates to the type of data and whether parametric or non-parametric tests should be used. Parametric tests assume underlying statistical distributions (e.g., normality) in the data, while non-parametric tests do not.

- **Assumption violation can lead to erroneous results and interpretation** – If the assumptions underlying a statistical test are not met, the results of the test may not be valid, which can lead to incorrect conclusions.

- **If assumptions are violated, you can:**
    - **Correct data so assumptions are met (Transformation)** – This might involve transforming the data (e.g., using a logarithmic transformation to correct for skewness) to better meet the necessary assumptions.
    - **Proceed anyway, report on assumption violation, and interpret cautiously** – Sometimes researchers may decide to continue with the analysis despite assumption violations, but it's crucial to report these violations and interpret the results with caution, as they may not be as reliable.
