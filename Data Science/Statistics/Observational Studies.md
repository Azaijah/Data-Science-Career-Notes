**Observational Study**: This is a research method where the investigator observes and measures variables of interest without intervening or altering the study environment or subjects. The essence of an observational study is to make inferences about the possible relationships or associations between variables.

### Types of observational studies

- **Retrospective Study (Case-Control Study)**: In this type of study, researchers look backwards in time. They start with an outcome (like a disease) and then trace back to investigate exposures to risk factors or interventions that might be associated with that outcome. Data collection in retrospective studies typically involves analyzing existing records or interviews with participants about past events. Such studies are particularly useful when studying diseases with long latency periods or rare conditions.

- **Cross-Sectional Study**: These are observational studies that analyze data from a population, or a representative subset, at one specific point in time. They are sometimes described as a 'snapshot' of the population. Cross-sectional studies can describe the prevalence of an outcome or disease and can be useful for generating hypotheses about associations between variables. However, they do not allow for inferences about causality or the sequence of events.

- **Prospective Study (Longitudinal or Cohort Study)**: Prospective studies look forward in time. Researchers follow a group of individuals, known as a cohort, who are similar in certain ways but differ in a particular characteristic under investigation (like smoking status). They then observe the subjects over a period to see how their exposures affect outcomes. This type of study is useful for investigating the causes of disease, establishing sequences of events, and examining the effects of risk factors or interventions.
