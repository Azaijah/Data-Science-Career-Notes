#statistics 

### Parameter vs. Statistic:
- **Parameter**: A measure that describes a characteristic of an entire population.
- **Statistic**: A measure that describes a characteristic of a sample from a population.

#### Examples
- **Parameter**: The total adult population size is considered a parameter.
- **Statistic**: The average (mean) height from a sample group is considered a statistic.

### Quantitative vs. Categorical Data:
- **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**: Represents counts or measurements, like height or age.
- **Categorical (Qualitative or Attribute) Data**: Consists of names or labels, like eye color or type of car.

#### Examples 
1. **Quantitative Data**: Ages in years in a clinical trial.
2. **Categorical Data as Labels**: Gender (male/female) in a clinical trial.
3. **Categorical Data as Numbers**: Identification numbers assigned to subjects, which are not quantitative but categorical.

### **Discrete/Continuous Data:**

- **Discrete Data**: Countable data values (e.g., coin tosses).
- **Continuous Data**: Uncountable data values, often on a continuum (e.g., lengths).
#### Examples 
1. **Discrete Data of the Finite Type**: Example given is the number of emergency care patients at Bellevue Hospital, which is countable daily. This is a finite set of data because there's a clear end to the count at the end of each day.
2. **Discrete Data of the Infinite Type**: Describes data that could theoretically be counted indefinitely (like memory tests), but in practice is finite due to human limitations.
3. **Continuous Data**: Data without discrete steps, allowing for measurement within a range. For instance, the length of python snakes is a continuous data set because there is an infinite number of possible measurements between the smallest and largest lengths.


### Levels of Measurement:

- **Nominal**: Data are in categories without a natural order (e.g., types of fruit).
- **Ordinal**: Data are in categories with a natural order but not measured (e.g., race positions).
- **Interval**: Ordered data with meaningful differences between measurements, but no true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
- **Ratio**: Like interval data, but with a meaningful zero point (e.g., weight).
