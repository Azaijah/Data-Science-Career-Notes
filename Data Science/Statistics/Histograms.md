A histogram is a graphical representation used in statistics to show the distribution of numerical data. It is a type of bar chart that visualizes the frequency of data points within specified ranges, known as bins or intervals. Histograms are useful for understanding the shape, spread, central tendency, and variability of the data, and they can help identify patterns, outliers, skewness, or any unusual observations in a dataset.
