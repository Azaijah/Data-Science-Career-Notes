**Data**: Collections of observations, such as measurements, respondent age and sex, or survey responses. A single data value is called a datum, a term rarely used. The term data is plural, so it is correct to say "data are..." not "data is...".

**Statistics**: The science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data; and organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and then drawing conclusions based on them.

**Population**: The complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered.

**Census**: The collection of data from every member of the population.

**Sample**: A subcollection of members selected from a population.
