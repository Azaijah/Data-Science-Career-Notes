### Definition and Purpose
A z-test compares sample data to a known population parameter to assess the significance of the difference. The primary purpose is to test hypotheses about population means under specific conditions. Similarly, t-tests are used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features or not.

### Types of Z-Tests
Z-tests are statistical procedures used to determine if there is a significant difference between sample statistics and known or assumed population parameters, specifically when the population variance is known and the sample size is large (typically n > 30). They are used for hypothesis testing and are based on the Z-distribution (standard normal distribution). Here are the primary types of Z-tests:

1. **One-Sample Z-Test**: Used to compare the mean of a single sample to a known population mean. This test is appropriate when the population variance is known and the sample size is large. It determines whether there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.

2. **Two-Sample Z-Test**: Compares the means of two independent samples. This is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two populations, based on samples from each population. It's suitable when the variances of both populations are known and the sample sizes are large.

3. **Proportion Z-Test**: Used when dealing with proportions rather than means. This can be applied in two ways:
   - **One-Sample Proportion Z-Test**: Determines whether the proportion of a certain characteristic in a sample differs significantly from a specific proportion in the population.
   - **Two-Sample Proportion Z-Test**: Compares the proportions of a characteristic between two independent samples to see if they differ significantly.

4. **Z-Test for the Difference Between Two Variances**: Although less common, this test is used to compare the variances of two populations based on samples from each, assuming that both samples are drawn from normally distributed populations.

Z-tests are applied in situations where the Central Limit Theorem can be invoked due to large sample sizes, which ensures that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. However, in practice, when the population variance is unknown, T-tests are often used instead because they account for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the population variance from the sample.

### Assumptions
Z-tests and t-tests rely on several critical assumptions:
- [[Normal Distribution]]: The sampling distribution of the mean should be approximately normal. This is generally satisfied if the sample size is large (central limit theorem) or the population is normally distributed. T-tests are more tolerant of deviations from normality.
- **Known Population Variance (Z-Test)**: The population variance (or standard deviation) must be known for z-tests. For t-tests, the population variance is unknown.
- **Independent Samples**: In two-sample z-tests and independent two-sample t-tests, the samples must be independent of each other.
- **Large Sample Size (Z-Test)**: Generally, a sample size greater than 30 is considered large enough for the central limit theorem to apply, making the distribution of the sample mean approximately normal. T-tests are suitable for smaller samples.

### Single and Two-Tailed Tests
- **Single-Tailed Test**: Tests for the possibility of the relationship in one direction and completely ignores the possibility of a relationship in the other direction.
- **Two-Tailed Test**: Tests for the possibility of the relationship in both directions. It is more conservative and is used when there is no specific direction of interest.
### Conducting a Z/T-Test
1. **State the Hypotheses**: Formulate the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).
2. **Select the Significance Level** (Î±), often set at 0.05.
3. **Calculate the Statistic** using the appropriate formula for the type of test.
4. **Determine the Critical Value or p-Value**: Use tables or statistical software to find the p-value associated with the calculated statistic.
5. **Make a Decision**: Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than the significance level, indicating a statistically significant difference.

### Interpretation
The outcome provides evidence regarding the null hypothesis. A low p-value suggests that the observed difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

### Applications
Both tests are widely used in research and decision-making to assess process changes, compare average outcomes between groups, and evaluate treatment effectiveness.

### Limitations
- **Z-Test**: Requires known population variances, often not practical.
- **T-Test**: More suitable for small samples but assumes population variance is unknown.
- Both tests assume normal distribution, which may not hold for small samples or non-normally distributed data.

Z-tests and t-tests are fundamental tools in statistics for hypothesis testing, each with its specific conditions and applications.
