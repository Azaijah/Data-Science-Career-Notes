**Exploratory Data Analysis - Notes**

1. **Summary/Description of Data Characteristics**
   - This step involves getting an overview of what the dataset contains. This includes understanding the sources, the types of variables (categorical, numerical), the range of values, and presence of any missing or special values.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Measures of Central Tendency**: These are statistics that represent the center point or typical value of the data. Common measures include the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).
   - **Dispersion**: These statistics describe the spread of the data. This includes range (difference between the highest and lowest values), variance (average of the squared differences from the mean), and standard deviation (square root of the variance).
   - **Position**: This refers to the standing of a value within the distribution. Quartiles and percentiles are common measures that tell us about the relative position of data points.
   - **Shape**: This describes the distribution of data. It includes skewness (how symmetrical the data is) and kurtosis (how peaked or flat the distribution is compared to a normal distribution).

3. **Outlier Detection**
   - Outliers are data points that are significantly different from most of the data. Detecting outliers is crucial as they can indicate variability in the data, experimental errors, or novel insights. Methods to detect outliers include statistical tests, visualization (like box plots), and proximity-based methods (such as clustering).
