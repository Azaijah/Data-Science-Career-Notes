The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is characterized by a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve where the majority of the observations cluster around the central peak, and the probabilities for values further away from the mean (the centre of the distribution) decrease symmetrically in both directions. The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The normal distribution is widely used in statistics, science, and engineering to model continuous variables that cluster around a single mean value, especially when the factors influencing a variable are many and each contributes a small amount to the total.

**The [[standard normal distribution]]**, also called the z-distribution, is **a special normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1**. Any normal distribution can be standardized by converting its values into z scores.
