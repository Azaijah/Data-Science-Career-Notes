#statistics 
The standard error (SE) of a statistic (most commonly the mean) is a measure of how much the sample statistic varies from the true population parameter it estimates, when different samples are taken from the same population. It provides a way to quantify the precision of the sample mean (or other statistic) as an estimate of the population mean (or population parameter).

The formula to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) is:

$[ SE_{\overline{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} ]$

where:
- \(s\) is the sample standard deviation,
- \(n\) is the sample size.

The standard error decreases as the sample size increases, reflecting that larger samples provide a more precise estimate of the population mean. The standard error is used in constructing [[Confidence intervals (CIs)|confidence intervals]] and conducting [[Hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]]. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would typically be calculated as $\overline{x} \pm 1.96 \times SE_{\overline{x}}$, assuming the sample mean ($\overline{x}$) is normally distributed or the sample size is large ([[Central  Limit  Theorem]]).
