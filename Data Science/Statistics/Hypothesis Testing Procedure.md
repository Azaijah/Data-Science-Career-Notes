1. **Test for assumptions** – This step involves validating that the data adhere to the assumptions necessary for the statistical test being used. [[Hypothesis Test Assumptions]].

2. **State the hypotheses ($H_0, H_1$)** – Formulate the null hypothesis ($H_0$), which posits no effect or no difference, and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$), which is the hypothesis you are testing for.

3. **Select the significance level ($\alpha$)** – The significance level $\alpha$ is the probability threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. Common values are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.

4. **Identify and calculate the test statistic** – Calculate a test statistic based on the sample data, which is compared to a theoretical probability distribution, such as the standard normal distribution, to ascertain the extremeness of the result assuming $H_0$ is true.

5. **Determine p-value (area under tail(s))** – The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, given that $H_0$ is true. It is found by looking at the area under the probability density function curve beyond the test statistic value.

6. **Make statistical decision (compare p-value to $\alpha$)** – If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level $\alpha$, reject $H_0$. Otherwise, do not reject $H_0$.

7. **Formally state conclusions considering the study context** – Interpret the results within the framework of the research question, taking into account the study design and data analysis.
