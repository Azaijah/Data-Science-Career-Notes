### Good experimental design

A well designed experiment often includes the following:

- **Replication**: Replication is a fundamental aspect of a well-designed experiment. It involves conducting the same experiment multiple times with multiple subjects to ensure that the results are consistent and not due to chance or outliers. This adds reliability to the findings.

- **Blinding**: Blinding is a technique used to eliminate bias in experiments. It means that the subjects do not know whether they are receiving the actual treatment or a placebo (a harmless, inert substance or fake treatment). The idea is to prevent the subjects' expectations from influencing the outcome of the study. The Salk vaccine experiment mentioned in the text was a double-blind study, meaning both the subjects (children) and the administrators (doctors) were unaware of who received the actual vaccine or placebo, eliminating bias on both ends.

- **Randomness**: Randomness is used to assign subjects to different groups in an unbiased manner. In the Salk vaccine experiment, random selection was used to create two groups that were similar in every respect except for the treatment received. This method ensures that the two groups are comparable, and any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself rather than other factors.

### Sampling

- **Simple Random Sample:** This is defined as a subset of a population where each member has an equal chance of being selected. It's a method to ensure that the sample represents the population well without bias. A simple random sample is important in research to generalize the findings from the sample to the larger population.

- **Systematic Sampling**: This is a method where you select samples based on a set interval - for example, choosing every 50th individual from a population. You start at a random point and then select every kth element.

- **Convenience Sampling**: This technique involves selecting samples that are easiest to access. It is not a random sampling method and is often used for pilot testing or initial research due to its ease, but it may not represent the population well.

- **Stratified Sampling**: In this method, the population is divided into subgroups, or strata, that share a common characteristic (like age, income level, or sex). Then, a sample is drawn from each subgroup. This ensures that the sample includes representation from each part of the population.

- **Cluster Sampling**: With this method, the population is divided into clusters (often geographically), and then a random selection of clusters is made. All individuals from the selected clusters are included in the sample. This method is often used when the population is too large and spread out to conduct simple random sampling.

- **Multistage Sampling**: Professional pollsters and government researchers often collect data by using some combination of the preceding sampling methods. In a multistage sample design, pollsters select a sample in different stages, and each stage might use different methods of sampling, as in the following example.  

### Sampling Errors:

- **Sampling Error (or Random Sampling Error)**: This type of error happens when a sample is randomly selected from a population, but there is a difference between the sample result and the actual population result. This discrepancy is due to random variations and is expected in probability sampling techniques.
- **Nonsampling Error**: This error results from human mistakes, including incorrect data entry, computational errors, biased questions, inaccurate responses from survey participants, biased conclusions, or inappropriate statistical methods for the data. Nonsampling errors are not related to the randomness of sample selection but rather to the execution of the sampling process and data handling.
- **Nonrandom Sampling Error**: This occurs when the sampling method used is not random, such as convenience sampling or voluntary response samples. These samples may not be representative of the population, leading to biases that affect the validity of the study's conclusions.
