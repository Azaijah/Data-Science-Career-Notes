- **Cumulative Frequency** refers to the sum of the frequencies of all values up to a certain point in a dataset. It shows the total number of observations that fall within a certain category or below a certain value when the data are sorted in ascending order. Cumulative frequency is expressed as a count or number of cases.
    
- **Cumulative Percent** (or Cumulative Percentage) takes the concept of cumulative frequency further by expressing the cumulative frequency as a percentage of the total number of observations. This is achieved by dividing the cumulative frequency by the total number of observations and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Cumulative percent helps in understanding the proportion of observations that fall below a certain value relative to the entire dataset.
