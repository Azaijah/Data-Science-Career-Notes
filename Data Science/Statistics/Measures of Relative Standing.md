### Measures of Relative Standing
A measure of relative standing isÂ a way to describe the relationship between a specific value in a data set with the rest of the values in the set, or, a way to compare values coming from different data sets with each other.


1. **Percentiles**: 
    - Definition: Percentiles divide a dataset into 100 equal parts. 
    - Key Point: The $n$th percentile is the value below which $n\%$ of the data falls.
    - Example: The 25th percentile, or the first quartile ($Q1$), marks the value below which 25% of the data lies, indicating the lower quarter of the data.

2. **Quartiles**: 
    - Definition: Quartiles split the dataset into four equal parts, offering a deeper insight into the distribution of data.
    - Key Points:
        - First Quartile ($Q1$) = 25th percentile: Represents the lower quarter of data.
        - Second Quartile ($Q2$) / Median = 50th percentile: Divides the dataset in half.
        - Third Quartile ($Q3$) = 75th percentile: Indicates where three-quarters of the data lies.
    - Usage: Quartiles are crucial for understanding the spread, central tendency, and potential skewness of the data. They are closely tied to the concept of the five number summary, which includes the minimum, $Q1$, median ($Q2$), $Q3$, and the maximum.

3. **Z-scores**: 
    - Definition: A Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset.
    - Formula: $Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}$
        - Where $X$ is the data point, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
    - Characteristics:
        - A positive Z-score indicates the data point is above the mean.
        - A negative Z-score indicates the data point is below the mean.
    - Importance: Z-scores are invaluable for comparing data points across different datasets or distributions by normalizing differences in scale and variability.
