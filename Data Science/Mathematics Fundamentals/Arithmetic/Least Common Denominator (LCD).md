The least common denominator (LCD) is a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially useful in fractions, allowing us to add, subtract, or compare fractions with different denominators. The LCD is the [[Least Common Multiple (LCM)]] (LCM) of the denominators of these fractions. Finding the LCD of two or more fractions means finding the smallest number that each of the denominators can divide into without leaving a remainder.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to find the LCD, followed by some examples:

### Steps to Find the LCD

1. **List the Prime Factors of Each Denominator**: Break down each denominator into its prime factors. Prime factorization involves dividing the number by prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) until we can no longer divide.

2. **Find the Unique Factors**: Identify all unique prime factors from all denominators.

3. **Choose the Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: If the same prime factor appears more than once across different denominators but with different powers, choose the highest power.

4. **Multiply the Prime Factors Together**: The product of these factors is the least common denominator.

### Example 1: Finding the LCD for $\dfrac{1}{4}$ and $\dfrac{1}{6}$

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 4: $2^2$
   - For 6: $2 \times 3$

2. **Unique Factors**: 2, 3

3. **Highest Power**: $2^2$ from 4, and 3 from 6

4. **LCD**: $2^2 \times 3 = 4 \times 3 = 12$

So, the least common denominator of $1/4$ and $1/6$ is 12.

### Example 2: Finding the LCD for $\dfrac {1} {3}$, $\dfrac {1}{4}$, and $\dfrac {1} {5}$

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 3: 3
   - For 4: $2^2$
   - For 5: 5

2. **Unique Factors**: 2, 3, 5

3. **Highest Power**: 3 from 3, $2^2$ from 4, and 5 from 5

4. **LCD**: $2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 = 60$

The least common denominator of $1/3$, $1/4$, and $1/5$ is 60.

### Example 3: Working Out LCD for $3/8$ and $5/9$

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 8: $2^3$
   - For 9: $3^2$

2. **Unique Factors**: 2, 3

3. **Highest Power**: $2^3$ from 8, and $3^2$ from 9

4. **LCD**: $2^3 \times 3^2 = 8 \times 9 = 72$

Hence, the least common denominator of $3/8$ and $5/9$ is 72.
