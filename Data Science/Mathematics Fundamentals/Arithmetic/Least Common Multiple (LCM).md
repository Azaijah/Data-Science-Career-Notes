The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of these integers without leaving a remainder. The concept of LCM is particularly useful in solving problems involving fractions, finding common denominators, and in various applications of algebra (such as finding the [[LCM of Algebraic Expressions]]) and number theory.

### Steps to Find the LCM

1. **Prime Factorization of Each Number**: First, find the prime factorization of each number. This involves breaking down each number into its prime factors (i.e., factors that are prime numbers).

2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: Look across the prime factorizations and identify the highest power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers.

3. **Multiply the Highest Powers Together**: The product of these highest powers of prime factors is the LCM.

### Example 1: Finding the LCM of 12 and 18

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 12: $2^2 \times 3$
   - For 18: $2 \times 3^2$

2. **Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: $2^2$ (from 12) and $3^2$ (from 18)

3. **LCM**: $2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36$

The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.

### Example 2: Finding the LCM of 8, 14, and 20

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 8: $2^3$
   - For 14: $2 \times 7$
   - For 20: $2^2 \times 5$

2. **Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: $2^3$ (from 8), 7 (from 14), 5 (from 20)

3. **LCM**: $2^3 \times 7 \times 5 = 8 \times 7 \times 5 = 280$

The LCM of 8, 14, and 20 is 280.

### Example 3: Finding the LCM of 21 and 28

1. **Prime Factors**:
   - For 21: $3 \times 7$
   - For 28: $2^2 \times 7$

2. **Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: 3 (from 21), $2^2$ (from 28), 7 (common to both but we take it once)

3. **LCM**: $3 \times 2^2 \times 7 = 3 \times 4 \times 7 = 84$

The LCM of 21 and 28 is 84.

### Working Out LCM Using the LCM Formula

For two numbers, you can also use the formula:

$\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}$

where GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b. This formula is particularly useful when the numbers are large and prime factorization would be cumbersome. However, for more than two numbers, finding the LCM generally involves iteratively applying the LCM process for pairs of numbers.

### Key Takeaways

- The LCM is found by taking the highest power of all prime factors that appear in any of the numbers.
- It ensures that the found number is the smallest one that all original numbers can divide into without leaving a remainder.
- Understanding the LCM is crucial for solving many problems in arithmetic, algebra, and number theory efficiently.
