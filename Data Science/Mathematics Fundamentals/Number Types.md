## Integers
- **Symbol**: $( \mathbb{Z} )$
- **Description**: Includes all whole numbers and their negatives, along with zero.
- **Examples**: $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$
## Natural Numbers
- **Symbol**: $( \mathbb{N} )$
- **Description**: Positive integers used for counting and ordering. Some definitions include zero, while others start with one.
- **Examples**: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$
## Real Numbers
- **Symbol**: $( \mathbb{R} )$
- **Description**: All possible numbers along the continuum of the number line, including rational and irrational numbers.
- **Examples**: $2, -1.5, (\sqrt{2}), (\pi)$
## Rational Numbers
- **Symbol**: $( \mathbb{Q} )$
- **Description**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
- **Examples**: $1/2, -3/4, 0.75, 2$
## Irrational Numbers
- **Description**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.
- **Examples**: $\sqrt{2}, (\pi), e$
## Imaginary Numbers
- **Description**: Numbers that are multiples of the imaginary unit \(i\), which is defined as the square root of -1.
- **Examples**: \(3i\), \(-i\), \(2i\)
## Complex Numbers
- **Symbol**: $( \mathbb{C} )$
- **Description**: Numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part, expressed as \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, and \(i\) is the square root of -1.
- **Examples**: $1 + 2i, -3 - 4i, 0 + 5i$
