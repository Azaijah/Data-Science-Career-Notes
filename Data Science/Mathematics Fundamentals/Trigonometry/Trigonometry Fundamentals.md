Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. It primarily focuses on right-angled triangles, where one of the internal angles is $90^\circ$. Here are some basic concepts and functions in trigonometry, which are defined based on the ratios of sides in a right-angled triangle.

### Basic Trigonometric Functions

For a right-angled triangle with:

- **Hypotenuse** ($c$): The side opposite the right angle and the longest side.
- **Opposite side** ($a$): The side opposite to the angle being considered.
- **Adjacent side** ($b$): The side next to the angle being considered and not the hypotenuse.

The primary trigonometric functions are:

1. **Sine ($\sin$)**: It is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - $\sin(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} = \frac{a}{c}$

2. **Cosine ($\cos$)**: It is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - $\cos(\theta) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = \frac{b}{c}$

3. **Tangent ($\tan$)**: It is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
   - $\tan(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \frac{a}{b}$

### Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions

There are also reciprocal functions of the primary trigonometric functions:

1. **Cosecant ($\csc$)**: Reciprocal of sine.
   - $\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite} = \frac{c}{a}$

2. **Secant ($\sec$)**: Reciprocal of cosine.
   - $\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent} = \frac{c}{b}$

3. **Cotangent ($\cot$)**: Reciprocal of tangent.
   - $\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{adjacent}{opposite} = \frac{b}{a}$

### Applications of Trigonometry

Trigonometry is used in various fields such as astronomy, physics, engineering, and geography to:

- Calculate distances that are difficult to measure directly.
- Model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves.
- Determine the position and angles in navigation and surveying.

### Trigonometric Identities

There are several important trigonometric identities that are useful in simplifying expressions:

1. **[[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean]] Identity**: Relates the squares of the primary trigonometric functions.
   - $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$
2. **Angle Sum and Difference Identities**: Allow the calculation of the sine, cosine, and tangent of the sum or difference of two angles.
3. **Double Angle and Half Angle Identities**: Provide formulas to calculate the trigonometric functions of double angles or half angles.


### Example Applications (Right Angle Triangles)

1. **Using Sine to Find the Length of the Opposite Side**:
   - Given: Hypotenuse ($c$) = 10 units, Angle $A$ = 30 degrees.
   - To find: Length of the opposite side ($a$).
   - Using the sine formula: $a = c \times \sin(A)$.
   - Result: The length of the opposite side ($a$) ≈ 5 units.

2. **Using Cosine to Find the Length of the Adjacent Side**:
   - Given: Hypotenuse ($c$) = 10 units, Angle $A$ = 60 degrees.
   - To find: Length of the adjacent side ($b$).
   - Using the cosine formula: $b = c \times \cos(A)$.
   - Result: The length of the adjacent side ($b$) ≈ 5 units.

3. **Using Tangent to Find the Length of the Opposite Side**:
   - Given: Adjacent side ($b$) = 5 units, Angle $A$ = 45 degrees.
   - To find: Length of the opposite side ($a$).
   - Using the tangent formula: $a = b \times \tan(A)$.
   - Result: The length of the opposite side ($a$) ≈ 5 units.

These examples illustrate the use of sine, cosine, and tangent ratios to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles based on the given angles and side lengths.
