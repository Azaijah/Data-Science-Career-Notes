The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, stating that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be expressed algebraically as:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$

### Example 1: Solve for Hypotenuse ($c$)

Given:
- $a = 8$
- $b = 6$

To find $c$, the length of the hypotenuse, we use the formula $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

Working out:
- $c^2 = 8^2 + 6^2$
- $c^2 = 64 + 36$
- $c^2 = 100$
- $c = \sqrt{100}$
- $c = 10$

Thus, the hypotenuse $c$ is 10.

### Example 2: Solve for Side ($a$)

Given:
- $c = 10$
- $b = 8$

To find $a$, one of the sides adjacent to the right angle, we rearrange the Pythagorean theorem to $a^2 = c^2 - b^2$.

Working out:
- $a^2 = 10^2 - 8^2$
- $a^2 = 100 - 64$
- $a^2 = 36$
- $a = \sqrt{36}$
- $a = 6$

Thus, the side $a$ is 6.

### Example 3: Solve for Side ($b$)

Given:
- $c = 15$
- $a = 9$

To find $b$, the other side adjacent to the right angle, we use the rearranged formula $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$.

Working out:
- $b^2 = 15^2 - 9^2$
- $b^2 = 225 - 81$
- $b^2 = 144$
- $b = \sqrt{144}$
- $b = 12$

Thus, the side $b$ is 12.

These calculations demonstrate the use of the Pythagorean theorem in solving for any side of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known.
