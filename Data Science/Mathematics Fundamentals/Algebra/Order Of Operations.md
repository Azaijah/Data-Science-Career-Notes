The order of operations in algebra is a set of rules for determining the sequence in which operations should be carried out to correctly evaluate mathematical expressions. The acronym BIMDAS helps remember this order:

1. **B** - Brackets: First, perform all operations inside parentheses "()", brackets "[]", and braces "{}". Nested brackets should be solved from the innermost to the outermost.

2. **I** - Indices (or Exponents): Next, calculate all indices (exponents or powers) and roots. This includes square roots, cube roots, etc.

3. **M/D** - Multiplication and Division: Then, perform all multiplication and division operations, moving from left to right across the expression. Note that multiplication and division are of equal priority and are done in the order they appear from left to right.

4. **A/S** - Addition and Subtraction: Finally, perform all addition and subtraction operations, moving from left to right across the expression. Like multiplication and division, addition and subtraction are of equal priority and are done in the order they appear from left to right.

### Examples:

1. **Solving an Expression with Brackets and Exponents:**

   "2 \times (3 + 2)^2"

   - Brackets: "2 \times 5^2"
   - Indices: "2 \times 25"
   - Multiplication: "50"

2. **Solving an Expression with All Operations:**

   "\frac{4 + (2^3 \times 3)}{2}"

   - Brackets and Indices: "\frac{4 + (8 \times 3)}{2}"
   - Inside Brackets (Multiplication): "\frac{4 + 24}{2}"
   - Addition inside Brackets: "\frac{28}{2}"
   - Division: "14"

Remember, the order of operations is crucial for ensuring that mathematical expressions are interpreted and solved consistently and correctly by all.
