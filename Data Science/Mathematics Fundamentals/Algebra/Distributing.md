Distributing, defined by the [[Properties of Operations#Distributive Law|distributive law]], involves multiplying a single term by each term within a parenthesis, effectively expanding the expression from a condensed form into a more extended form, such as applying $a(b + c)$ to get $ab + ac$. 

This operation is directly related to [[Factoring (Basics)]], which is the inverse process where a complex expression is broken down into simpler, multiplied components. Essentially, while distributing expands an expression, factoring condenses it back into a product of factors. 


For example, distributing would take $(x + 2)(x + 3)$ to $x^2 + 5x + 6$, and factoring reverses this process, turning $x^2 + 5x + 6$ back into $(x + 2)(x + 3)$. Understanding the relationship between these two operations is crucial for manipulating and solving algebraic expressions efficiently.
