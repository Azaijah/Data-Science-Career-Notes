Inequalities are mathematical expressions involving the symbols $>$ (greater than), $<$ (less than), $\geq$ (greater than or equal to), and $\leq$ (less than or equal to) to compare two values or expressions. Algebraic inequalities involve variables and can be solved or analyzed to find the range of values that satisfy the inequality. Here are the basic types and how to solve them:

### Types of Inequalities

1. **Linear Inequalities:** Inequalities involving linear expressions (no variable is raised to a power greater than one). For example, $2x + 3 > 7$.
2. **Quadratic Inequalities:** Involving a quadratic expression, such as $x^2 - 4 < 0$.
3. **Rational Inequalities:** Involving ratios of polynomials, like $\frac{x-1}{x+2} \geq 0$.
4. **Absolute Value Inequalities:** Involving the absolute value function, such as $|x - 3| > 2$.

### Solving Inequalities

#### Linear Inequalities

1. **Isolate the variable:** Aim to get the variable on one side of the inequality.
2. **Perform inverse operations:** Add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides by the same number (except 0) to isolate the variable. If you multiply or divide by a negative number, reverse the direction of the inequality.
3. **Solution:** Express the solution as an inequality, a graph on a number line, or an interval notation. See: [[Solving Linear Inequalities]]

#### Quadratic Inequalities

1. **Factor the quadratic expression** (if possible).
2. **Determine the critical points** (where the expression equals 0).
3. **Test intervals** between and beyond the critical points to see where the inequality holds.
4. **Solution:** Combine the intervals that satisfy the inequality.

#### Rational Inequalities

1. **Find the critical points** (where the numerator is 0 or the denominator is undefined).
2. **Test intervals** created by these points to determine where the inequality is true.
3. **Solution:** Express the solution as a combination of intervals, excluding points where the denominator is 0.

#### Absolute Value Inequalities

1. **Write two cases** for the inequality, one where the expression inside the absolute value is positive and one where it's negative (and reverse the inequality for the negative case).
2. **Solve each case separately.**
3. **Combine solutions** if it's an "or" inequality ($|x| > a$) and find the intersection if it's an "and" inequality ($|x| < a$).

### Example

Solve the inequality: $2x + 3 > 7$.

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: $2x > 4$.
2. Divide by 2: $x > 2$.

The solution is all real numbers greater than 2, which can be expressed as $x > 2$ or, in interval notation, $(2, \infty)$.
