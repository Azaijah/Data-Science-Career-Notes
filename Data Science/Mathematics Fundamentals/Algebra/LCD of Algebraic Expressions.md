The [[Least Common Denominator (LCD)]] of algebraic expressions, similar to the LCD of numbers, is the smallest expression that each of the given expressions can divide into without leaving a remainder. It's particularly useful when adding, subtracting, or comparing fractions with algebraic expressions in their denominators. To find the LCD of algebraic expressions, you follow a process that combines numerical and variable factors. Here are detailed notes on how to find the LCD of algebraic expressions:

### Step 1: Factorize Each Denominator

1. **Numerical Factors**: Break down each numerical part of the denominators into prime factors.
2. **Variable Factors**: For variables, factorize expressions into their simplest polynomial forms, such as factoring $x^2 - 9$ into $(x + 3)(x - 3)$.

### Step 2: Identify Unique Factors

1. List all unique factors from all denominators, both numerical and variable. 
2. For variable factors that appear in multiple denominators in different powers, only consider the highest power.

### Step 3: Construct the LCD

1. **Multiply Unique Factors**: Combine all unique factors by multiplying them together. For factors that are common to more than one denominator, use the highest power that appears in any of them.
2. The product of these factors is the LCD of the given algebraic expressions.

### Examples

Let's consider two examples for clarity.

#### Example 1: Simple Variables

Consider the denominators $x$ and $x^2 - 4$.

1. The first denominator is already in its simplest form, $x$.
2. The second denominator factorizes to $(x - 2)(x + 2)$.
3. The LCD must include $x$, $(x - 2)$, and $(x + 2)$, making the LCD $x(x - 2)(x + 2)$.

#### Example 2: Mixed Numerical and Variable Factors

Consider the denominators $6x^2$ and $4x(x - 1)$.

1. The first denominator, $6x^2$, breaks down into $2 \cdot 3 \cdot x^2$.
2. The second denominator, $4x(x - 1)$, breaks down into $2^2 \cdot x \cdot (x - 1)$.
3. Combining unique factors, we get the LCD as $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot (x - 1)$ or $12x^2(x - 1)$.

### Considerations

- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: Sometimes, especially when reducing fractions to their simplest form, it's helpful to also identify the GCF of the numerators and denominators.
- **Complex Expressions**: For more complex algebraic expressions, consider using synthetic division or polynomial long division where applicable, especially when dealing with higher-degree polynomials.
- **Checking Work**: Always verify by multiplying the LCD by each original fraction's denominator. The result should simplify to the numerator of each fraction, indicating correct LCD calculation.

Finding the LCD of algebraic expressions is a foundational skill in algebra that supports operations involving fractions, allowing for the simplification and comparison of algebraic fractions.
