Factoring refers to the process of decomposing an expression into a product of simpler expressions that, when multiplied together, give the original expression.

Used to 
- simplify expressions.
- solve equations.
- analyse mathematical structures.

##### Factoring a Monomial
A monomial is an algebraic expression made up of one term. To factor a monomial, you find all its prime factors.
$12x^2y = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot y$

##### Factoring by Greatest Common Factor
When factoring expressions, the first step is often to take out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of all the terms.
$6x^2 + 8x = 2x(3x + 4)$

##### Factoring Quadratics
Quadratic expressions can often be factored into two binomials.
$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)$

##### Factoring by Grouping
When an expression contains four or more terms, we can sometimes use factoring by grouping.
$x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 6 =$ 
$x^2(x + 3) + 2(x + 3) =$
$(x^2 + 2)(x + 3)$

##### Factoring the Difference of Squares
A difference of squares is factored into two binomials.
$x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$

##### Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials
A perfect square trinomial can be factored into a binomial squared.
$x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$

##### Factoring Difference or Sum of Cubes
The **difference of cubes** and **sum of cubes** formulas are algebraic identities that allow for the factoring of expressions involving cubic terms into products of simpler expressions.

For any two terms $a$ and $b$, the difference of their cubes can be expressed as:
$a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$

For any two terms $a$ and $b$, the sum of their cubes can be expressed as:
$a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$

##### Factoring Cubics and Higher Degree Polynomials
For higher degree polynomials, factoring can be more complex and may involve synthetic division, the Rational Root Theorem, or other methods.

Additional notes:
- You can check your factoring simply by [[distributing]] (the opposite of factoring) and seeing if you end up with the original expression. 
- Unlike the [[Factoring#Factoring Difference or Sum of Cubes|sum of cubes]] you cannot factor the sum of squares
