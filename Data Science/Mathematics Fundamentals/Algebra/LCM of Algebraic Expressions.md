Finding the least common multiple (LCM) of algebraic expressions extends the concept of finding the LCM of integers to include variables and their exponents. This process is crucial when working with algebraic fractions, especially when adding, subtracting, or comparing fractions that have algebraic expressions as denominators.

### Steps to Find the LCM of Algebraic Expressions

1. **Factor Each Expression Completely**: This involves factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) if any, then factoring polynomials into products of factors, including recognizing special products like difference of squares, perfect square trinomials, etc.

2. **Identify the Unique Factors**: From all expressions, identify all unique factors, both the numerical and the algebraic (variable) parts.

3. **Choose the Highest Power of Each Factor**: For each unique factor, choose the highest power that appears in any of the expressions.

4. **Multiply These Factors Together**: The product of these factors gives you the LCM of the algebraic expressions.

### Example: Find the LCM of $2x^2y$ and $8xy^3$.

1. **Factor Each Expression**:
   - $2x^2y = 2 \cdot x^2 \cdot y$
   - $8xy^3 = 2^3 \cdot x \cdot y^3$

2. **Identify Unique Factors**: The unique factors are $2$, $x$, and $y$.

3. **Choose the Highest Power of Each Factor**:
   - The highest power of $2$ is $2^3$ (from $8xy^3$).
   - The highest power of $x$ is $x^2$ (from $2x^2y$).
   - The highest power of $y$ is $y^3$ (from $8xy^3$).

4. **Multiply These Factors Together**: 
   - LCM = $2^3 \cdot x^2 \cdot y^3 = 8x^2y^3$.

Therefore, the LCM of $2x^2y$ and $8xy^3$ is $8x^2y^3$.

### Example: Find the LCM of $3x^2 - 3$ and $x^2 - 1$.

1. **Factor Each Expression**:
   - $3x^2 - 3 = 3(x^2 - 1)$
   - $x^2 - 1$ can be factored further as $(x + 1)(x - 1)$ using the [[Factoring#Factoring the Difference of Squares|difference of squares]]

   Note that $x^2 - 1$ is a common factor, but we can factor it further for the first expression:
   - $3(x^2 - 1) = 3(x + 1)(x - 1)$

2. **Identify Unique Factors**: The unique factors are $3$, $x + 1$, and $x - 1$.

3. **Choose the Highest Power of Each Factor**: All factors are already in their highest form in this example.

4. **Multiply These Factors Together**:
   - LCM = $3 \cdot (x + 1) \cdot (x - 1)$.

Therefore, the LCM of $3x^2 - 3$ and $x^2 - 1$ is $3(x + 1)(x - 1)$ or $3(x^2 - 1)$.


### Example: Find the LCM of $3$ and $x-3$

1. **Factor Each Expression**
	- $3 = 3$
	- $x-3 = x-3$
2. **Identify unique factors** 
	- $3, x - 3$
3. **Choose the Highest Power of Each Factor**: All factors are already in their highest form in this example.
4. **Multiply These Factors Together**:
	- $3 \cdot  (x-3)$
