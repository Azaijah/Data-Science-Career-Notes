The corrected graph above now accurately shows the graphical solution of the system of linear equations with the equations $2x + 3y = 5$ and $4x - y = 3$. The exact intersection point, accurately calculated, is at $(x, y) = (1, 1)$, which is clearly marked with a red dot on the graph. This point represents the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously, demonstrating the solution to the system. ​​
