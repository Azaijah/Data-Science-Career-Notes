### 1. Simple Linear Equation
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $2x + 3 = 7$.

**Solution:** Subtract 3 from both sides to get $2x = 4$, then divide by 2 to find $x = 2$.

### 2. Linear Equation with Variables on Both Sides
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $4x - 5 = 3x + 2$.

**Solution:** Subtract $3x$ from both sides to get $x - 5 = 2$, then add 5 to both sides to find $x = 7$.

### 3. Linear Equation with Fractions
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $\frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 7$.

**Solution:** Subtract 3 from both sides to get $\frac{1}{2}x = 4$, then multiply by 2 to find $x = 8$.

### 4. Linear Equation with the Variable in the Denominator
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $\frac{5}{x} = 1$.

**Solution:** Multiply both sides by \(x\) to get $5 = x$, indicating $x = 5$.

### 5. Linear Equation with Decimals
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $0.5x + 1.2 = 2.7$.

**Solution:** Subtract 1.2 from both sides to get $0.5x = 1.5$, then divide by 0.5 to find $x = 3$.

### 6. Linear Equation Requiring Distribution
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $3(2x - 4) = 18$.

**Solution:** Distribute to get $6x - 12 = 18$, add 12 to both sides to get $6x = 30$, then divide by 6 to find $x = 5$.

### 7. Linear Equation with Negative Coefficients
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $-3x + 6 = 0$.

**Solution:** Subtract 6 from both sides to get $-3x = -6$, then divide by -3 to find $x = 2$.

### 8. Linear Equation Involving Percentages
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $120\% \cdot x = 24$.

**Solution:** Convert 120% to 1.2 and divide both sides by 1.2 to find $x = 20$.

### 9. Linear Equation with a Variable on One Side and Numbers on the Other
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $5x = 25$.

**Solution:** Divide both sides by 5 to find $x = 5$.

### 10. Complex Linear Equation with Multiple Steps
**Example:** Solve for \(x\): $2(x - 3) + 4(x + 2) = 3x + 18$.

**Solution:** First, distribute to get $2x - 6 + 4x + 8 = 3x + 18$, then combine like terms to get $6x + 2 = 3x + 18$. Next, subtract $3x$ and 2 from both sides to get $3x = 16$, then divide by 3 to find $x = \frac{16}{3}$.
