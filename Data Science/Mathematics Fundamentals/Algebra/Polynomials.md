Polynomials are mathematical expressions involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. The basic structure of a polynomial revolves around terms and operations. 

## Definition

**Term:** The building block of a polynomial, which consists of a coefficient (a number) and a variable (like $x$) raised to a non-negative integer exponent. For example, $3x^2$ is a term.

**Coefficient:** A number multiplying the variable in a term. In $3x^2, 3$ is the coefficient.

**Degree of a Term:** The exponent of the variable in a term. For $3x^2$, the degree is $2$.

**Constant Term:** A term without a variable, effectively a term of degree 0. For example, 4 is a constant term.


## Structure of Polynomials:

**Polynomials can consist of** a single term, known as a monomial (e.g., $2x$), two terms, known as a binomial (e.g., $2x + 3$), or three terms, known as a trinomial (e.g., $x^2 + 3x + 2$). Additionally, a polynomial can contain many terms.

**The degree of a polynomial** is determined by the highest degree of its individual terms when the polynomial is arranged in its standard form, which is with the terms written in descending order of degree. For example, the polynomial 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 3 has a degree of 3, because the highest exponent in the polynomial is 3.


## What is not a Polynomial

A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables. An expression is not considered a polynomial if it includes any of the following:

1. **Division by a variable**: An expression that involves a variable in the denominator is not a polynomial. For example, $1/x$ is not a polynomial.
2. **Negative or fractional exponents**: Expressions that contain variables raised to a negative or fractional power are not polynomials. For example, $x^{-1}$ or $x^{1/2}$ are not considered polynomials.
3. **Variables in the exponent**: An expression where a variable is used as an exponent is not a polynomial. For example, $2^x$ is not a polynomial.
4. **Roots involving variables**: Expressions that involve taking the root of a variable, such as $\sqrt{x}$â€‹, are not polynomials.
5. **Trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions involving variables**: Expressions that include trigonometric functions (e.g., sin($x$)), logarithms (e.g., $log(x)$), and exponential functions (other than those with a constant base and a linear exponent, like $e^x$) with variables are not polynomials.
