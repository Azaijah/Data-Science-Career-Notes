A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. These equations are called "linear" because they represent straight lines in Cartesian coordinates. The solution to a system of linear equations is the set of values that satisfy all the equations in the system simultaneously. There are several methods to solve these systems, including graphing, substitution, elimination, and matrix methods (such as using determinants or row reduction).

### Types of Systems

- **Consistent:** A system is consistent if it has at least one solution. If it has exactly one solution, it is also called independent. If it has more than one solution, it is called dependent.
- **Inconsistent:** A system is inconsistent if it has no solutions. This usually happens when the lines represented by the equations are parallel and do not intersect.

### Methods of Solving Systems of Linear Equations

1. **Graphing:** Each equation is graphed, and the solution is the point(s) where the graphs intersect. [[Solving Linear Systems Using the Graphing Method]]
2. **Substitution:** Solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the others and substitute this expression into the other equations. [[Solving Linear Systems Using the Substitution Method]]
3. **Elimination (or Addition):** Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve for the remaining variables. [[Solving Linear Systems Using the Elimination Method]]
4. **Matrix Methods:** Use matrices and operations such as row reduction (Gaussian elimination) or determinant calculations to find the solutions.

### Examples

A simple example of a system of linear equations is:

1. $2x + 3y = 5$
2. $4x - y = 3$

The solution to this system would be the values of $x$ and $y$ that make both equations true simultaneously.
