Equations of a line can be represented in various forms, each providing different insights into the line's properties such as slope, y-intercept, and x-intercept. The two most common forms are the Slope-Intercept Form and the Standard Form. Regarding [[Parallel and Perpendicular Lines]], two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (m) but different y-intercepts (b). Perpendicular lines, on the other hand, have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other ($m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$). This relationship ensures that the lines intersect at a right angle.

### Slope-Intercept Form

The Slope-Intercept Form of a line's equation is expressed as:
$y = mx + b$

Where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable (usually representing vertical position),
- $x$ is the independent variable (usually representing horizontal position),
- $m$ is the slope of the line, indicating the [[rate of change]] of $y$ with respect to $x$,
- $b$ is the y-intercept, which is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$, indicating where the line crosses the y-axis.

The **Slope-Intercept Form** directly reveals the slope and y-intercept of a line, making it easy to graph and understand the line's behavior. The slope, m, indicates the line's steepness and direction, whereas the y-intercept, b, shows where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Standard Form

The Standard Form of a line's equation is expressed as:
$Ax + By = C$

Where:
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integer constants,
- $A$ should be a non-negative integer,
- $x$ and $y$ are variables representing points on the line.

The **Standard Form** is beneficial for identifying intercepts and for performing operations like addition and subtraction of equations. It's also preferred when dealing with lines in more formal or theoretical contexts, such as in linear algebra.

### Converting Between Forms

**From Slope-Intercept to Standard Form:**
To convert an equation from slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$) to standard form ($Ax + By = C$), you rearrange the equation to eliminate fractions and get $A$, $B$, and $C$ as integers. For example, to convert $y = 2x + 3$ to standard form, you would subtract $2x$ from both sides to get $-2x + y = 3$, which can be rewritten as $2x - y = -3$ if following the convention that $A$ should be positive.

**From Standard to Slope-Intercept Form:**
To convert from standard form ($Ax + By = C$) to slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), solve the equation for $y$. For example, converting $2x - y = -3$ to slope-intercept form involves adding $y$ to both sides and subtracting $3$ from both sides to get $y = 2x + 3$.

Each form has its use cases and advantages, and understanding how to convert between them and what each represents is crucial in algebra and geometry.


### Point-Slope Form

The Point-Slope Form of a line's equation is another useful way to express the equation of a line, particularly when you know a point on the line and its slope. This form is especially handy for writing equations quickly without needing to calculate the y-intercept. The Point-Slope Form is given by:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Where:
- $m$ is the slope of the line,
- $(x_1, y_1)$ is a specific point on the line,
- $x$ and $y$ are the variables representing any point on the line.

### Understanding Point-Slope Form

The Point-Slope Form directly utilizes the slope of a line and a known point to define the line's equation. This form is derived from the slope formula:

$m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$

Rearranging this formula to solve for $y$ gives you the Point-Slope Form. It explicitly shows how the vertical change $(y - y_1)$ between any point $(x, y)$ on the line and the known point $(x_1, y_1)$ is proportional to the horizontal change $(x - x_1)$, with the proportionality constant being the slope $m$.

### Example

If you know a line has a slope of 3 and passes through the point (2, -1), you can write the equation of the line in Point-Slope Form as:

$y - (-1) = 3(x - 2)$

Which simplifies to:

$y + 1 = 3(x - 2)$

### Converting to Other Forms

You can also convert the Point-Slope Form to other forms like the Slope-Intercept Form or the Standard Form by algebraic manipulation. For instance, continuing the example above, you could distribute the 3 and add 1 to both sides to get it into the Slope-Intercept Form $y = mx + b$:

$y + 1 = 3x - 6$
$y = 3x - 7$

The Point-Slope Form is particularly useful for quickly writing the equation of a line in situations where you're given a point and the slope, and it's a fundamental tool in algebra and calculus for understanding linear functions and their graphs.
