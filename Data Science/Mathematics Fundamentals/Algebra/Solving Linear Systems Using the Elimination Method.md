The elimination method, also known as the addition method, is a technique for solving systems of linear equations. This method involves adding or subtracting the equations in order to eliminate one of the variables, making it possible to solve for the other variable. The goal is to reduce the system of equations to a single equation in one variable, which can then be solved easily. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the elimination method:

### Steps to Solve Using the Elimination Method

1. **Prepare the equations.** If necessary, multiply one or both of the equations by a constant so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same (or exact opposites) in both equations.

2. **Eliminate one variable.** Add or subtract the equations from each other to eliminate one of the variables. This will give you an equation with only one variable.

3. **Solve for the remaining variable.** Solve the resulting equation from step 2 to find the value of one of the variables.

4. **Substitute and solve for the other variable.** Use the value found in step 3 and substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable.

5. **Check your solution.** Substitute the values of the variables back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations.

### Example

Consider the system of equations:
1. $2x + 3y = 6$
2. $4x - y = 11$

**Step 1:** Prepare the equations. To eliminate $y$, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of $y$ opposites:
- First equation remains the same: $2x + 3y = 6$
- Second equation becomes: $12x - 3y = 33$

**Step 2:** Eliminate $y$ by adding the equations:
- $(2x + 3y) + (12x - 3y) = 6 + 33$
- $14x = 39$

**Step 3:** Solve for $x$:
- $x = \frac{39}{14}$

**Step 4:** Substitute $x = \frac{39}{14}$ into one of the original equations to solve for $y$. Using the first equation:
- $2(\frac{39}{14}) + 3y = 6$
- $\frac{78}{14} + 3y = 6$
- $3y = 6 - \frac{78}{14}$
- $3y = \frac{84}{14} - \frac{78}{14}$
- $3y = \frac{6}{14}$
- $y = \frac{2}{14} = \frac{1}{7}$

**Step 5:** Check the solution $(x, y) = \left(\frac{39}{14}, \frac{1}{7}\right)$ in both original equations to ensure they are satisfied.

This method systematically reduces the complexity of the system by focusing on one variable at a time, making it easier to find the solution.
