### What is a Function?

- **Definition:** A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.
- **Analogy:** Think of a function as a machine or a black box that takes something in (input), does something with it, and then gives something back (output).

### Notation and Terms

- **Notation:** Functions are usually written as $f(x)$ where $f$ is the function name, and $x$ is the input variable. The output is often referred to as $f(x)$, pronounced "f of x".
- **Domain:** The set of all possible inputs for the function.
- **Codomain:** The codomain of a function is the set of all possible outputs that the function could potentially provide, based on its definition. 
- **Range:** The set of all possible outputs for the function.
- **$x$:** Input value or independent variable.
- **$f(x)$:** Output value or dependent variable.

### Codomain vs. Range

- While the codomain encompasses all possible outputs that could theoretically come from the function, the range is more specificâ€”it is the set of all outputs that actually do come from the function, given the particular domain being used. In simpler terms, the range is a subset of the codomain that consists of the actual values produced by the function.
### Types of Functions

1. **Linear Function:** Direct proportionality between input and output. Form: $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2. **Quadratic Function:** Characterized by a squared term. Form: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.
3. **Polynomial Function:** A sum of terms, each consisting of a variable raised to a non-negative integer power. Example: $f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 7$.
4. **Rational Function:** A ratio of two polynomial functions. Example: $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$.
5. **Exponential Function:** Has a constant base raised to a variable exponent. Form: $f(x) = a^x$.
6. **Logarithmic Function:** The inverse of an exponential function. Form: $f(x) = \log_a(x)$, where $a$ is the base of the logarithm.

### Understanding Functions

- **Visualization:** Functions can often be visualized using graphs on a coordinate plane, which helps in understanding their behavior.
- **Inverse Functions:** If a function $f$ takes an input $x$ and gives an output $y$, then its inverse function $f^{-1}$ takes $y$ as an input and gives $x$ as an output.
- **Composite Functions:** Combining two functions where the output of one function becomes the input of another.
