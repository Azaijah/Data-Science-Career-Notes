Functions are fundamental concepts in mathematics and play a crucial role across various branches, including calculus, algebra, and more. At its core, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs, where each input is related to exactly one output. The formal definition, applications, and implications of functions are vast, so here's an overview to get started:

### Definition

A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ (the domain) exactly one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $E$ (the codomain). The set of all possible outputs of $f$ is called the range of $f$.

### Notation

Functions are usually denoted by letters such as $f$, $g$, $h$, and so on. If $f$ is a function with domain $D$ and for some element $x$ in $D$, $f$ assigns the element $y$ in $E$, we write $f(x) = y$.

### Types of Functions

1. **Linear Functions**: Represented by the formula $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2. **Quadratic Functions**: Given by $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$.
3. **Polynomial Functions**: More general than quadratics, involving terms of $x^n$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
4. **Rational Functions**: Quotients of polynomials, represented as $f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ where $q(x) \neq 0$.
5. **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**: Involving powers and logarithms of variables, such as $y = a^x$ and $y = \log_a(x)$.
6. **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like $sin(x)$, $cos(x)$, and $tan(x)$ which are fundamental in studying triangles and modeling periodic phenomena.

### Properties of Functions

- **Injective (One-to-One)**: Each element of the domain maps to a unique element of the codomain.
- **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element of the domain.
- **Bijective (One-to-One Correspondence)**: The function is both injective and surjective, establishing a perfect pairing between the domain and codomain.

### Operations with Functions

- **Composition**: Given two functions $f$ and $g$, the composition $f \circ g$ is defined by $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$.
- **Inverse Functions**: If $f$ is a bijective function, its inverse $f^{-1}$ reverses the assignment of $f$, so that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.

### Applications

Functions are used to model relationships between quantities, solve equations, and describe phenomena in physics, engineering, economics, and more. They are the building blocks for calculus, where concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals revolve around functions.

Understanding functions is essential for progress in mathematics and its applications in science and engineering. Each type of function has its own set of characteristics and uses, making them indispensable tools in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
