##### Communicative Law:
The Commutative Law applies to addition and multiplication and states that changing the order of the operands does not change the outcome.
$a + b = b + a$
$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$

##### Associative Law:
The Associative Law applies to addition and multiplication and states that the way operands are grouped does not affect the outcome. This law allows for the association of terms without changing the result

$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$

##### Distributive Law:
The Distributive Law connects addition and multiplication, stating that multiplying a sum by a number gives the same result as multiplying each addend by the number and then adding the products.
$a(b+c)=ab+ac$
$a(b−c)=ab−ac$
