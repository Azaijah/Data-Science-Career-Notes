##### Product Rule: 
When you multiply two powers that have the same base, you add the exponents.
$x^n \times x^m = x^{n+m}$

##### Quotient of Powers Rule:
When you divide two powers that have the same base, you subtract the exponents.
$\dfrac{x^n}{ x^m} = x^{n-m}$

##### Power of Power Rule: 
When raising a power to another power, you multiply the exponents.
$(x^n)^m = x^{n \times m}$

##### Zero Exponent Rule: 
Any base (except 0) raised to the zero power is 1.
$x^0 = 1$
This makes sense because it is consistent with the **Quotient Rule** $\dfrac {2^2 }{2^2} = 2^0 = 1$

##### Negative Exponent Rule:
A negative exponent indicates that the base is on the opposite side of the fraction and should be taken to the positive power.
$x^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{x^n}$
This makes sense because it is consistent with the **Product Rule** $5^7 \times 5^{-7} = 5^{7 + (-7)} = 5^0 = 1$  So...... $\dfrac {5^7 \times 5^{-7}} {5^7} = \dfrac {1} {5^7}$ So...... $5^{-7} = \dfrac {1} {5^7}$

##### Fractional Exponents:
 A fractional exponent represents a root, where the numerator is the power and the denominator is the root.
$x^{\frac {1} {n}} = \sqrt[n]{x}$  ...... $64^{\frac{1} {3}} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ ..... $9^{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{9} = 3$ ........ $(5^{\frac {1} {3}})^3 = 5^{\frac{1}{3}\times3} = 5^1 = 5$

##### Distribute an exponent over a Product:
When you raise a product to an exponent, you distribute the exponent to each factor within the product.
$(a b)^n = a^n b^n$

##### Distribute an exponent over a Quotient:
When you raise a quotient to an exponent, you distribute the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator of the quotient.
$\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}$


**Shortcuts**:
- You can pass a factor across a fraction bar by switching the sign 
	- A negative exponent in the numerator becomes a positive exponent in the denominator.
	- A negative exponent in the denominator becomes a positive exponent in the numerator. 

**Additional notes**:
- Take care for negative signs i.e $168^0 = 1$, $(-412)^0 = 1$, $-8^0 = -1$
