Solving linear inequalities is a fundamental skill in algebra that helps you understand how to find the range of values that satisfy an inequality. A linear inequality looks much like a linear equation, except it uses inequality symbols ($<$, $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$) instead of an equals sign. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve them:

### 1. Understand the Inequality Symbols
- $<$ means "less than."
- $>$ means "greater than."
- $\leq$ means "less than or equal to."
- $\geq$ means "greater than or equal to."

### 2. Solving the Inequality
Just like solving a linear equation, you aim to get the variable on one side of the inequality. Here are the general steps:

#### Step 1: Simplify Both Sides
If there are like terms on either side of the inequality, combine them. If there are fractions, you might want to clear them by multiplying every term by the least common denominator.

#### Step 2: Get the Variable on One Side
Use addition or subtraction to get the variable term on one side of the inequality and the constant terms on the other side.

#### Step 3: Isolate the Variable
If the variable is not alone, use multiplication or division to isolate it. 

### 3. Special Considerations
- **Flipping the Inequality Sign:** If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must flip the direction of the inequality sign. This does not apply when multiplying or dividing by a positive number.
- **Checking Solutions:** You can check your solution by substituting values from the solution set into the original inequality to see if it makes the inequality true.
- **Graphing Solutions:** To represent the solution on a number line, use an open circle to represent "$<$" or "$>$" and a closed circle for "$\leq$" or "$\geq$". Draw a line to the left or right to represent the range of solutions.

### Example Problem
Solve the inequality: $2x - 5 > 3$.

#### Solution Steps
1. Add 5 to both sides to isolate terms with $x$: $2x > 8$.
2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for $x$: $x > 4$.

The solution means that any value greater than 4 makes the original inequality true.
