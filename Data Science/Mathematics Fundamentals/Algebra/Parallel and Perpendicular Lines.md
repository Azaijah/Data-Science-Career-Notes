Parallel and perpendicular lines are fundamental concepts in geometry & algebra, characterized by their unique properties related to slope and orientation in the Cartesian coordinate system.

### Parallel Lines

Parallel lines are lines in a plane that never meet; they are always the same distance apart, no matter how far they are extended. In terms of their algebraic representation, parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. For example, the lines represented by the equations $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = 2x - 3$ are parallel because both have a slope of $2$ but different y-intercepts ($1$ and $-3$, respectively).

#### Properties of Parallel Lines

- They have the same slope.
- They do not intersect.
- The angle between them is always $0$ degrees (or $180$ degrees, depending on how you measure it).

### Perpendicular Lines

Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a right angle ($90$ degrees). Algebraically, if two lines are perpendicular, the slope of one line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the other. If the slope of one line is $m$, the slope of a line perpendicular to it is $-1/m$. For instance, if one line has the equation $y = \frac{1}{2}x + 2$, a line perpendicular to it could be $y = -2x + 3$, since the slope of the first line is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the slope of the perpendicular line is $-2$ (the negative reciprocal of $\frac{1}{2}$).

#### Properties of Perpendicular Lines

- The product of their slopes is $-1$ (i.e., $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$ where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the slopes of the two lines).
- They intersect at a right angle.

### Determining Parallel or Perpendicular Lines

To determine if two lines are parallel, compare their slopes:

- If $m_1 = m_2$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the slopes of two lines, then the lines are parallel.

To determine if two lines are perpendicular:

- If $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, then the lines are perpendicular.

### Example

Given two lines with equations $y = 3x + 5$ and $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$, determine if they are parallel or perpendicular.

- The slope of the first line is $3$, and the slope of the second line is $-\frac{1}{3}$.
- Since the product of the slopes is $3 \cdot (-\frac{1}{3}) = -1$, the lines are perpendicular.

Understanding the properties of parallel and perpendicular lines is crucial for solving various geometric problems, including those involving triangles, rectangles, and other polygons, as well as for tasks related to coordinate geometry.
