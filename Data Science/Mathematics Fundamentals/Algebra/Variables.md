#algebra
In algebra, a variable is a symbol used to represent an unknown or arbitrary number. Variables are typically denoted by letters such as $x, y, a, b$ etc. They are used to express relationships and patterns in mathematical expressions and equations.

### key points:

1. **Representation of Unknowns:** Variables are used to represent unknown quantities. For example, if you don't know the value of a particular number, you can use a variable to stand in for that unknown value.
    
    Example: Let $x$ represent the number of apples. If you have 5 apples, then $x=5$.
    
2. **Expression and Equations:** Variables are commonly used in algebraic expressions and equations. An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and mathematical operations, while an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions.
    
    Example of an expression: $2x + 3$
    
    Example of an equation: $2x + 3 = 7$
    
3. **Solving Equations:** In algebra, one often works with equations to find the value of the variable that satisfies the equation. This process is known as solving the equation.
    
    Example: Solve the equation $y= 2x + 3$ for $x$. The solution is $x = 2$.
    
4. **Dependent and Independent Variables:** In some contexts, variables are classified as dependent or independent. The independent variable is the one that can be freely chosen or manipulated, while the dependent variable depends on the independent variable.
    
    Example: In the equation $y= 2x + 3$, $x$ is the independent variable, and  is the dependent variable.
    
5. **Patterns and Functions:** Variables are often used to express patterns and functions. A function is a specific type of relationship between variables where each input (independent variable) corresponds to exactly one output (dependent variable).
    
    Example: $f(x) = 2x + 3$  represents a linear function where $x$ is the input and $f(x)$ is the output.
