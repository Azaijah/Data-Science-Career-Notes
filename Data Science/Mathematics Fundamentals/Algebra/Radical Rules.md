##### Product rule: 
The square root (or any root) of a product is equal to the product of the roots.

$\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$

##### Quotient Rule:
The square root (or any root) of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the roots.

$\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$

##### Power Rule: 
A radical raised to a power is equal to the radicand (the value from which you are taking the root) raised to that power.

$(\sqrt[n]{a})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$

##### Fractional exponent rule: 
Raising a number to a fractional power is equivalent to taking an *n*th root of the number raised to the *m*th power. 
$a^\frac{m}{n} = \sqrt[n]a^m$

##### Rationalizing the Denominator: 
The process of removing a radical from the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by an appropriate form of 1.
$\frac{a}{\sqrt{b}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{b}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{b}} = \frac{a\sqrt{b}}{b}$

$\dfrac {3x} {\sqrt x} = \dfrac {3x} {\sqrt x} \times \dfrac {\sqrt x} {\sqrt x} = \dfrac {3x \times} {(\sqrt x)^2} = \dfrac {3x \sqrt x} {x} = 3 \sqrt x$ 


##### Simplifying Radicals: 
Simplifying radicals by taking out of the radical any factor that is a perfect square (for square roots) or a perfect power (for nth roots).
$\sqrt{a^2b} = a\sqrt{b}$
$\sqrt[n]{a^n b} = a\sqrt[n]{b}$
