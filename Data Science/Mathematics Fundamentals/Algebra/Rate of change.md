Finding the slope of a line is a fundamental concept in algebra and geometry, reflecting the **rate** at which the line rises or falls as you move from left to right along the line. The slope is usually represented by the letter $m$. There are several ways to find the slope of a line depending on the information you have:

1. **From Two Points on the Line**
   If you have two points on the line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope of the line connecting these points is calculated using the formula:
   $$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

2. **From the Equation of the Line**
   - **Slope-Intercept Form:** If the equation of the line is in the slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept, the slope is the coefficient of $x$.
   - **Standard Form:** If the equation is in the standard form, $Ax + By = C$, you can rearrange it into the slope-intercept form to find the slope. The slope $m$ is $-\frac{A}{B}$.

3. **Graphically**
   If you have a graph of the line, you can find the slope by identifying two points on the line and using the formula given in method 1. Alternatively, you can visually determine the "rise over run" between these two points: the change in the vertical direction (rise) divided by the change in the horizontal direction (run).

4. **From a Table of Values**
   If you have a table of values that lie on the line, you can select any two points from the table and use the slope formula from method 1 to find the slope.

**Example Calculation**
To illustrate, let's calculate the slope of a line passing through the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$:
$$m = \frac{6 - 2}{3 - 1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$$
The slope of this line is 2, which means for every 1 unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by 2 units.
