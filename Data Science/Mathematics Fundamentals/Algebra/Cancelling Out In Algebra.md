The concept of "cancelling out" in algebra refers to the simplification of expressions by removing common factors from the numerator and denominator of a fraction. Below is a detailed explanation with steps:
### Understanding Factors

- **Factor:** A factor of a number is a whole number that can be multiplied by another whole number to get the original number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because $1 \times 6 = 6$ and $2 \times 3 = 6$.
- **Common Factor:** A common factor is a factor that two or more numbers have in common. For example, the common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

### Simplifying Algebraic Fractions

- **Step 1: Factorization**  
  The first step in simplifying an algebraic fraction is to factor both the numerator (top part) and the denominator (bottom part) completely. This might involve factoring out a greatest common factor, factoring a trinomial into a product of two binomials, or other factoring techniques.

- **Step 2: Identify Common Factors**  
  Once you have factored the numerator and denominator, you look for any common factors that appear in both. These are what you will be able to "cancel out."

- **Step 3: Cancellation**  
  You can "cancel" common factors by dividing them out of both the numerator and denominator. This is because any number divided by itself is 1, and multiplying by 1 does not change the value of an expression.

### Rules of Cancellation

- You can only cancel factors, not terms. A term is a part of an expression that is added or subtracted. For example, in the expression $a + b$, $a$ and $b$ are terms. You cannot cancel a term that is being added or subtracted within a numerator or denominator; you can only cancel factors that are being multiplied.
  
- Cancellation is actually division. When you cancel a factor in the numerator with the same factor in the denominator, you are dividing both by that factor.

### Example: Simplifying $\frac{a^2 + 3a}{a + 3}$

- Factor the numerator: The expression $a^2 + 3a$ can be factored to $a(a + 3)$ because $a$ is a common factor of both terms.

- Look at the denominator: The denominator is already a single term, $a + 3$, and cannot be factored further.

- Cancel common factors: We now have $\frac{a(a + 3)}{a + 3}$. The factor $a + 3$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so we can cancel it out.

- Simplified expression: After cancelling, we're left with $a$, which is the simplified form of the original expression.

### Important Note

- You cannot cancel out terms if they are not part of a product (meaning they are not multiplied by each other). You can only cancel out a factor that is common to the numerator and denominator.

- Division by zero is undefined, so if the common factor could be zero, you must state that it is not allowed. For instance, in the example above, we cannot have $a + 3 = 0$ because then the denominator would be zero, which is not permitted in mathematics. This implies $a \neq -3$ in our simplified expression.
