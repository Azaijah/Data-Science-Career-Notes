Factoring trinomials is a key concept in algebra, useful for solving quadratic equations, simplifying expressions, and more. The approach varies slightly depending on whether the leading coefficient (a) is 1 or not. Here are notes on both situations:

### Factoring Trinomials when $a = 1$

A trinomial is a polynomial with three terms, typically in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. When $a = 1$, the trinomial simplifies to $x^2 + bx + c$.

**Steps to Factor:**

1. **Identify $b$ and $c$**: Start by noting the values of $b$ (the coefficient of $x$) and $c$ (the constant term).
2. **Find Two Numbers** that multiply to $c$ and add up to $b$. These are the numbers $r$ and $s$ such that $r \times s = c$ and $r + s = b$.
3. **Write the Factorized Form**: Once $r$ and $s$ are found, the factorized form is $(x + r)(x + s)$.

**Example**:
Factor $x^2 + 5x + 6$.

- Here, $b = 5$ and $c = 6$.
- We look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5, which are 2 and 3.
- Thus, the factorized form is $(x + 2)(x + 3)$.

### Factoring Trinomials when $a \neq 1$

With the leading coefficient $a$ not equal to 1, the trinomial is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, requiring a slightly more intricate method to factor.

**Steps to Factor:**

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**: Find the product of $a$ and $c$. This helps in finding numbers that not only add to $b$ but whose product is $a \times c$.
2. **Find Two Numbers** that multiply to $a \times c$ and add up to $b$. These are the numbers $p$ and $q$ such that $p \times q = a \times c$ and $p + q = b$.
3. **Split the Middle Term**: Rewrite the middle term $bx$ using $p$ and $q$ as two separate terms that sum to $b$.
4. **Factor by Grouping**: Group the terms into pairs and factor out the common factor from each.
5. **Write the Factorized Form**: This often results in a common binomial factor, yielding the final factorized form.

**Example**:
Factor $2x^2 + 7x + 3$.

- Multiply $a$ and $c$, yielding $2 \times 3 = 6$.
- Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 7, which are 6 and 1.
- Rewrite the trinomial as $2x^2 + 6x + x + 3$.
- Factor by grouping: $2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)$.
- Factor out the common binomial: $(2x + 1)(x + 3)$.

These structured approaches provide a pathway to factoring trinomials, whether $a$ is 1 or not. Practicing with diverse problems will enhance understanding and proficiency in factoring trinomials.
