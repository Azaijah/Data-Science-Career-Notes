Rational expressions are fractions that involve [[polynomials]] in the numerator, the denominator, or both. Simplifying and operating with these expressions requires a solid understanding of polynomial factoring, finding common denominators, and applying the basic properties of arithmetic operations. Let's dive into each of the topics you've listed:

##### 1. Simplify Rational Expressions by Factoring and Cancelling Common Factors

- **[[Factoring]]**: Start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator of the rational expression into their simplest forms. This involves identifying the greatest common factor (GCF), difference of squares, trinomials, or other factoring techniques.
- **Cancelling Common Factors**: Once both the numerator and the denominator are factored, cancel out any common factors that appear in both. Remember, only factors can be cancelled; terms separated by addition or subtraction cannot be cancelled out.

##### 2. Find the Least Common Denominator for Two or More Rational Expressions

- **Identify the Denominators**: Write down all the denominators of the given rational expressions.
- **Factor Each Denominator**: Factor each denominator into its prime or irreducible factors if they are not already in factored form.
- **Build the LCD**: The least common denominator (LCD) is found by taking the highest power of each prime or irreducible factor that appears in any of the denominators.

##### 3. Add and Subtract Rational Expressions

- **Find the LCD**: Before adding or subtracting, convert each expression to have the same denominator, which is the LCD.
- **Combine Numerators**: Once all expressions have the same denominator, add or subtract the numerators as indicated.
- **Simplify**: Factor and simplify the resulting expression if possible.

##### 4. Multiply and Divide Rational Expressions

- **Multiplication**: Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Then, factor and simplify the resulting expression by cancelling any common factors.
- **Division**: Flip the second rational expression (take the reciprocal) and then multiply. Factor and simplify the resulting expression by cancelling any common factors.

##### 5. Simplify Complex Rational Expressions

Complex rational expressions are fractions that have a rational expression in the numerator, the denominator, or both. To simplify:

- **Combine Into a Single Fraction**: Use the LCD to combine the expressions in the numerator and the denominator into single rational expressions.
- **Divide**: Simplify the complex rational expression by dividing the numerator by the denominator. This often involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the denominator.
- **Simplify Further**: Factor and cancel any common factors.

##### 6. Recognize Common Errors in Simplifying Rational Expressions

- **Cancelling Across a Plus or Minus Sign**: A common mistake is to cancel terms across a plus or minus sign, which is not valid. Only factors can be cancelled, not terms.
- **Ignoring the Domain**: When simplifying rational expressions, it's crucial to consider the domain of the expression and note any restrictions on the variable that may arise from zero denominators.
- **Incorrect Factoring**: Incorrectly factoring polynomials can lead to errors in simplification. Double-check your factoring work.
