An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, typically involving variables and constants. It is written as two expressions separated by an equals sign ("="). The primary goal of an equation is to represent a relationship between the expressions, where both sides of the equation are equivalent under certain conditions.

Equations can come in many forms and complexities, from simple linear equations with one variable (like $x+2=5$) to more complex [[Polynomials|polynomial]] equations, differential equations, or systems of equations involving multiple variables.


1. **Linear Equations:**
    - Involves variables raised to the power of 1.
    - Examples: $(ax + b = 0)$ or $(2y - 3x = 5).$

1. **Quadratic Equations:**
    - Involves variables raised to the power of 2.
    - General form: $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$
    - Solutions can be found using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}$
2. **Cubic Equations:**
    - Involves variables raised to the power of 3.
    - General form: $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$
3. **Quartic Equations:**
    - Involves variables raised to the power of 4.
    - General form: $ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0$
4. **Exponential Equations:**
    - Involves variables in the exponent.
    - Example: $a \cdot b^x = c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.
5. **Logarithmic Equations:**
    - Involves logarithmic functions.
    - Example: $\log_b(x) = c$, where $b$ is the base of the logarithm.
6. **Trigonometric Equations:**
    - Involves trigonometric functions.
    - Example: $\sin(x) + \cos(x) = 1$
7. **Systems of Equations:**
    - Involves multiple equations with the same set of variables.
    - Linear systems involve linear equations, and nonlinear systems involve other types.
    - Example: $\begin{cases} 2x + 3y = 5 \\ 4x - y = 2 \end{cases}$`
8. **Differential Equations:**
    - Involves derivatives and is used in calculus.
    - Example: $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$
9. **Integral Equations:**
    - Involves integrals and is also used in calculus.
    - Example: $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = c$
10. **Diophantine Equations:**
    - Involves integer solutions only.
    - Example: $3x + 5y = 7$, where $x$ and $y$ must be integers.
