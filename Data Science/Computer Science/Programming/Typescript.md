1. **Static Type Checking**: TypeScript provides static type checking, allowing developers to check the type of a variable, parameter, or return value at compile time. This feature helps catch errors early in the development process.

2. **Type Annotations**: Developers can explicitly declare the type of variables, function parameters, and return values using type annotations. This feature enhances code readability and maintainability.

3. **Interfaces**: TypeScript introduces interfaces, which are contracts for objects or classes to implement. Interfaces are used to define the shape of an object, making the code more structured and predictable.

4. **Classes and Inheritance**: TypeScript supports modern object-oriented programming features, including classes and inheritance. These features enable developers to create complex applications using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

5. **Enums**: Enums are a feature that allows for the definition of named constants, making the code more readable and maintainable by providing meaningful names to numeric values.

6. **Generics**: Generics provide a way to create reusable and flexible components by allowing types to be parameters to methods, classes, and interfaces. This feature helps in creating collection classes that work with any data type.

7. **Modules**: TypeScript supports modules, allowing developers to organize code into separate files and namespaces. This feature facilitates code reuse and maintainability.

8. **Namespaces**: Namespaces are used to group related functionalities under a named scope, preventing name conflicts in large applications.

9. **Type Inference**: TypeScript can infer the type of a variable based on its value, reducing the need for explicit type annotations while still providing the benefits of type checking.
    
1. **Union Types and Intersection Types**: These features allow for more flexible type composition, enabling variables to hold values of multiple types and combining types, respectively.

1. **Type Guards**: Type guards are a feature that allows for checking the type of a variable within conditional blocks, enabling more type-safe code.

1. **Advanced Types**: TypeScript includes advanced types like tuples, which allow for typed arrays with fixed lengths and types; and literal types, which restrict a variable to specific values.

1. **Decorators**: Decorators provide a way to add annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members. They are used in frameworks like Angular for declarative programming.

1. **Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing**: These features, introduced in later versions, provide more concise and readable ways to handle null and undefined values in JavaScript.

1. **ES6/ESNext Support**: TypeScript supports ES6 features (like arrow functions, promises, and template literals) and newer ECMAScript standards, compiling them down to ES5 or other versions for broader browser compatibility.

1. **Integration with JavaScript Libraries**: Through declaration files (`.d.ts`), TypeScript can work with existing JavaScript libraries, allowing developers to use TypeScript in projects that rely on these libraries.

1. **Tooling Support**: TypeScript has excellent tooling support with integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors, providing features like code completion, refactoring, and debugging.
